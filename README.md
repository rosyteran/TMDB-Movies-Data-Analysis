# TMDB Movies Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and analyzing data from The Movie Database (TMDB). The project aims to gain insights into various aspects of movies, including popularity trends, genres, budgets, revenue, and ratings, using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from TMDB and contains information about thousands of movies, including their titles, release dates, genres, budgets, revenues, ratings, and other relevant attributes. This dataset enables the exploration of trends and patterns in the movie industry over time and provides valuable insights for stakeholders such as filmmakers, producers, and movie enthusiasts.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, analysis, and visualization process.
- **reports:** Contains reports generated from the analysis, including visualizations, summary statistics, and insights.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

The data exploration and analysis process involve examining various attributes of movies to uncover interesting trends and patterns. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, are calculated to summarize the data. Additionally, visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, are created to visualize relationships between different variables and identify correlations.

Key components of the data exploration and analysis process include:

- Exploring movie genres and popularity trends
- Analyzing budget and revenue distributions
- Investigating the relationship between budgets and box office performance
- Examining ratings and their impact on movie success
